## Associated Frameworks

### OpenFaaS

OpenFaaS allows "serverless" functions to be more easily deployed to Kubernetes clusters.

### Cilium

Cilium is a container network interface for Kubernetes that provides enhanced eBPF-based networking, observability, and security features. It is intended as a replacement for `iptables`. eBPF runs sandboxed programs in Linux kernels.

### Knative

Knative is a platform-agnostic solution for running serverless deployments.

### KubeVirt

KubeVert is a Kubernetes-based solution for orchestrating virtual machines using Kubernetes.

### OpenTelemetry

Kubernetes leverages OpenTelemetry (or "OTel") to generate, aggregate, export, and orchestrate the collection of telemetry data. OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework.
